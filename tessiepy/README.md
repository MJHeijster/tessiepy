# TessiePy

Python wrapper for the [Tessie](https://tessie.com) API.

## Project Info

This project is incomplete and unlikely to be finished or released. I'm using it as part of my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) home automation system, and only included the functionality I specifically needed.

If you're interested in a fully fledged TessiePy, or fully fledged Tessie integration for HomeAssistant, open an issue or email me at charleszink@gmail.com - I would be happy to work on it with someone!
